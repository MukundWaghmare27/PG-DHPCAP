Correct Answer: A - [4, 10] Difficulty Level: Hard Topic: Anonymous Functions (Map Function)

Explanation:
The first elements from each list are passed to the multiply function: multiply(1, 4) which gives 1 * 4 = 4.
The second elements from each list are passed to the multiply function: multiply(2, 5) which gives 2 * 5 = 10.
The third element in the first list (3) does not have a corresponding element in the second list, so the map() function stops here.
Q. No. 15: What will the following code output?


[ ]
# A list to hold lambda functions
funcs = []
x = 3
# Defining three lambda functions in a loop
for i in range(3):

6
6
6

Correct Answer: B - [6, 6, 6] Difficulty Level: Hard Topic: Lambda Functions

At first glance, you might expect the output to be 0, 3, 6. However, due to late binding, the variable i is looked up when the lambda functions are called, not when they are defined. Since the loop completes before we call any function, i is always 2 at the time of each call.

Q16: Which of the following correctly defines a function in Python? Answer Choices: A. def func(): B. function func() C. create function func D. def func

Correct Answer: A - def func(): Difficulty Level: Easy

Explanation:
The first elements from each list are passed to the multiply function: multiply(1, 4) which gives 1 * 4 = 4.
The second elements from each list are passed to the multiply function: multiply(2, 5) which gives 2 * 5 = 10.
The third element in the first list (3) does not have a corresponding element in the second list, so the map() function stops here.
