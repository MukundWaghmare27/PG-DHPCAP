step1: compiled the code with flag -g for debugging
	after running the code desired output is incorrect 
	desired output: 1 2 3 4 5
	incorrect output: 1 2 3 4 5 0
step2: debug using gdb
	made breakpoing at for loop 
	run the program
	till breakpoint it runs
	by using next cmd and print i cmd checked the all iterations
	iteration only should go till 4 (0-4) but i value going till 5
step3: corrected the for loop
	for(int i=0; i<5; i++)
	
Debugging Completed
